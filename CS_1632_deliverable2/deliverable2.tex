\section{Descriptions of Issues}
The biggest Issue I had while creating the JUnit tests in this project was
methods that called other methods that were part of the same Object that 
was under test. I was unable to figure out exactly how to stub a method so
that I could verify that it was called while having a real object that I 
could call the method I was testing with.

Writing test also changed my coding style. Many of my functions returned 
void or used global variables rather than passing in parameters. A similar 
example of this was that at the start my parseInput function read from 
stdin itself. This was hard to test so I rewrote it so that it recived 
input as a parameter which was much easier to test. This shift in style 
seems to be similar to the shift towards functional programming. I feel 
that writing these test helped clean up the quality of my code.
