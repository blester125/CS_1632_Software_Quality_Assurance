\section{Summary}
For this project I decided to test Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/). 
I choose this site for a few reasons. The first is that is very like Reddit which 
is the site my roommates tested for this deliverable last semester (it is also 
the site tested in sample Selenium code). This site has several features that 
make testing a natural fit. The features of the site itself make sense and are 
easy to test well. The site lets users create accounts, login, make posts, and 
post comments. These features are very self contained and easy to make a test 
plan for.

The site itself is also lends itself to testing. The site is very simple. There 
is little javascript or dynamic content. This means that finding elements on the 
page is fairly easy. The site also lacks captchas on user creation, link posting, 
and comments. This means that all the core functionality can be automated. The 
site also lacks checks for valid urls when posting a link which means that no 
test url is required for test purposes. The simplicity of the site really helps 
make automated test. 

A user for test purposes was created with credentials username: 
``1632TestAccount'' and password: ``1632TestAccount''
\section{Challenges}
One concern for this test plan is that you are making tests that have no real 
content (according to the type of content that the site wants). This means that 
the test account is likely to be flagged as a bot or else get timed out for 
posting to much. This actually happened on a few runs of my tests. The test would 
create a comment on the top post at that time. When the test is run multiple 
times in a short amount of time the site stops the comment from being added and 
tells the user they are posting too much. This causes the test to fail because 
the test then looks for the new post which is obviously not there. If a lot of 
these tests are being run this could happen a lot.

The next step moving forward would be to test functions of the site as a 
moderator of the site (Which I assume the site has). A moderator would have the 
ability to filter, delete, move posts and the like. Unlike Reddit, Hacker News, 
doesn't allow for users to create small sections of the site (subreddits) that 
they are moderators of. This means that to be a moderator of Hacker News and test 
these functions I would need to be a moderator of the entire site. In a 
production environment these moderation functions must be tested.
